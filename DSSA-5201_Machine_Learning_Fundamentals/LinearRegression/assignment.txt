Write a linear regression algorithm from scratch in R, which prints coefficients and accuracy metrics (e.g. R2) and plots the actual versus predicted response variables. Compare the R2 of the results using your algorithm to the R2 of the results using lm() and predict(). Document each step of the code to demonstrate you understand what each line of code does. The code has to describe the steps of the linear regression model. For your algorithm, you may use basic statistical functions and graphing functions but NOT machine learning functions (i.e. no lm(), no predict() and related functions). Note, you must explain what solve() is doing if you use it (i.e. an explanation for a general audience more than “The function solves the equation”).
