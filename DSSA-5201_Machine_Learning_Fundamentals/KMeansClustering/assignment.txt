Write R code from scratch for a K-Means Clustering algorithm using Euclidean distances, which prints the total within-cluster sum of squares and displays a graph using the Elbow Method to determine an appropriate K.
Document each step of the code to demonstrate you understand what each line of code does. The code has to describe the steps in creating the model and steps in computing the sum of square errors. For your algorithm, you may use basic statistical functions and graphing functions but NOT machine learning functions such as kmeans(). You can use the attached dataset to test your model, but that is optional.
If you can, compare your algorithm's output of clusters to the algorithms in R using kmeans(). Feel free to experiment with alternative measurements but at least one method must employ Euclidean distances.
