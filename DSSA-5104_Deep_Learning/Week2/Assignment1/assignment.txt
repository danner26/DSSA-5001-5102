Using Numpy and matplotlib plot the "Loch Ness Monster" function (my name for it) . Note that some math functions such as exp and sin are found within numpy.

y = 2 + e-bxsin(x)

for a domain  x = 0 to 30 taking b = 0.05 and with 100 points.

Repeat for b = 0.1

[Requires just 5-10 lines of code]

Provide your plots (with an explanation of why they look like they do) and your code in a pdf as always.
