A, B,  C and D are matrices given below:
        130  120  105                6  7               5  2  7                245
A =      4      3      1        B =  4  5         C = 3  5  1         D =     6
            2      5      1                8  9               7  2  1                    7
Using Numpy compute:
A+ C
A- C
AC
CD

Solve the matrix equation (linear system) for x:
A x = D
This system written out in full looks like:
130x +120y +105z = 245
4x +3y + z = 6
2x +5y +z = 7
and solves the following problem:
I'm going on a diet and have decided I need to eat exactly 245 calories, 6 grams of protein and 7 grams of fat.
Unfortunately, I open my cupboard to see that all I have is three boxes of cereal: Cheerios, Cinnamon Toast Crunch, and Rice Krispies. The nutritional information per serving is as follows:
Cereal                                   Calories     Protein     Fat
Cheerios                                     120          4           2
Cinnamon Toast Crunch             130          3           5
Rice Krispies                               105          1           2

First I denote c as the number of servings of Cheerios, t as the number of servings of Cinnamon Toast Crunch and 
r as the number of servings of Rice Krispies then the three equations above have to be true simultaneously.
