Prepare a Python code using Keras to solve our toy problem.
As always document your code with comments.
Run the model for different numbers of Epochs: 150,500,1500
Plot graphs of accuracy and loss versus epoch number for these three cases.
Create an interesting visualization showing how well your model performed by plotting predictions versus observed targets.
