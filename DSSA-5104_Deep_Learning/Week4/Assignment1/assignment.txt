You have been given a zip file containing several facial images (labeled photo1.png, photo2.png etc).. You have also been given a facial image of a well known spy in a file called DC.png

Write a Python code to look through all the images and find which one is the spy.

To do this you should write a Python function that returns the SSR of the differences between two images. Then run through each image in the collection and choose the one that has the lowest SSR. Of course, you don't have to write a function to compute SSR - you can just compute right in the code with

SSR = np.sum( (x-y)**2 )

where x and y are the arrays to compare.

but using a function is cleaner.

This is how your code should start:

======================================

from PIL import Image, ImageFilter
import numpy as np

#Read image
spy = Image.open( 'DC.png' )
spy.show()


# Convert to numpy array
pix1 = np.array(spy)

from os import listdir  # import function for listing all files

# Get listing of all files
listing = listdir()

# Now loop through all files that end in png - you will need to open each file as image, convert to numpy array

# then compare the two arrays by computing the SSR between them - you should have that in a function


for file in listing:
    if file.endswith('.png'):
